# All-platform Facebook Connect

---

There are many existing libraries to help integrate Facebook into Angular and
Cordova applications.  However, in my experience, each suffers from one or more
serious flaw.  This library attempts to reconcile these flaws with the following
core features:

* Works seamlessly on all main supported Cordova platforms: iOS, Android, Browser

* Works seamlessly when running in a web browser outside the Cordova framework (i.e. when cordova.js has not been loaded)

* Provides native controls on iOS and Android (as in-app embedded browsers require the user to reauthenticate if they're already authenticated at the OS level)

## Get Started

**(1)** Install facebookConnectPlugin

**(2)** Install allPlatformFacebookConnect

## Important Note

This software is incomplete and a work in progress. It is untested on Android.
